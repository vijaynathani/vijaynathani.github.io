I prefer Android over iPhone because Android gives me more hardware choices. Also Android has more customizations available.

I prefer Android over Windows phone primarily because there are more apps on Android. These apps are more frequently updated. Also, I have had poor experience with a Windows Lumia phone i.e.

* No USB tethering
* WiFi tethering automatically switches off after few minutes of not using it. It has to be switched on, again and again.
* Phone has to be restarted every week for stability.

Android phones do not have the above problems.

I have been changing my mobile phone, almost every year now. I get dissatisfied with my existing mobile phone and am attracted to new mobiles. Now, I use only "Android One" or "Nexus" mobiles. The primary reason is that Google gives very fast updates on these devices. Other manufacturers like Samsung, LG, etc take a long time to give updates, if they do decide to update their phones.

A phone that is frequently updated will likely have fewer bugs. Also most apps will run on it. So given a choice, prefer "Android one" or Nexus Android mobile over iPhone and Windows mobiles
