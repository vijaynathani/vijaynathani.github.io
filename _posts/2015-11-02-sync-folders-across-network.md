I have lots of files and folders on my PC. When I travel, I want to copy them on my laptop. For this I have tried following options, but they were too time-consuming.

1. Copy everything in external drive and then copy it back to my laptop.
2. Copy everything over the network to destination
3. Zip everything in one file. Then transfer this one zip file to laptop and unzip.

Ultimately, I decided to write my own utility for syncing files and folders between my PC and laptop.

The source code in C# is at [GitHub](https://github.com/vijaynathani/SyncFolders).

A executable file for Windows OS along with a Readme file, is present [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqNLIEmvLOY).

A demo can be found on [YouTube](https://sites.google.com/site/nathanivijay/sync-folders-over-network

I hope you find this small utility useful.
