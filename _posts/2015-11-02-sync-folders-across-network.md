I have lots of files and folders on my PC. When I travel, I want to copy them on my laptop. For this I have tried following options, but they were too time-consuming.

* Copy everything in external drive and then copy it back to my laptop.

* Copy everything over the network to destination

* Zip everything in one file. Then transfer this one zip file to laptop and unzip.

Ultimately, I decided to write my own utility for syncing files and folders between my PC and laptop.
The source code in C# is at [GitHub](https://github.com/vijaynathani/SyncFolders).
A executable file for Windows OS along with a Readme file, is present [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqNLIEmvLOY).
A demo can be found on [YouTube](https://sites.google.com/site/nathanivijay/sync-folders-over-network
)

I hope you find this small utility useful.
