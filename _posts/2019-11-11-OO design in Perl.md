title: Object Oriented design in Perl

I conducted a training workshop on Object oriented design in Perl recently. Initially, many people were not sure whether the SOLID OO principles will be applicable in Perl. But, I think that OO principles are general. They are applicable to every OO language.

Obviously, the manner in which interfaces, abstract classes and concrete classes are created will vary. So the manner in which OO principles are applied will vary. But the concepts remain the same.

I have applied OO principles to many languages by now C++, Java, C#, Python, PHP, Groovy and now Perl.
