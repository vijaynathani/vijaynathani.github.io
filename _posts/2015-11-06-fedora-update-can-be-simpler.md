I just updated my from Fedora Linux 22 to Fedora Linux 23, in VirtualBox on Windows. For the update, Fedora documentation says give a [set of four commands](https://fedoramagazine.org/upgrading-from-fedora-22-to-fedora-23/).

Why should everyone give the same set of four commands? Why not have one command for most people, who want to upgrade? That single command can execute a set of commands.
