title: Hire Developers with code on GitHub

We usually have many developers applying for a small number of jobs.
It is difficult to distinguish a good developer from others,
just by looking at the CV/profile. So I suggest, look at the
code written by developer and published on GitHub.

In todays world, if a developer does not know how to use
Git/GitHub, then he probably need to update his skills. So we can consider hiring these developers later.

A good developer can usually recognize well written code. So by reviewing the code on GitHub, we can get an idea about the skill of the developer. Now, we only have to interview a few good developers. So it is likely that we will get better result with lesser effort.
